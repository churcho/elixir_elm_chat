# PerfqChatBackend

To start your Phoenix app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

## Chat

You can just visit <http://localhost:4000> to join `room:lobby`, or you can hit
<http://localhost:4000?room:lobby2> to join `room:lobby2`.  The elm app can join
either or both of these channels.
